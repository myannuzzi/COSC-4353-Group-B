# COSC-4353-Group-B - Graph Quest!

Graph Quest is [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/myannuzzi/COSC-4353-Group-B.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/myannuzzi/COSC-4353-Group-B) !


# About Graph Quest:
Graph quest is a graph data manipulation and visualization library for Python. Graph Quest allows you to input a file, turn it into a pandas dataframe, and then turn it into an adjacency matrix. Graph Quest comes with other features as well. Graph quest allows for users to create graph data structures, perform graph based functions on them (insert and remove nodes, insert and removed edges) and perform graph algorithms on the data structures. Graph quest also allows you to perform other library functions on the graph data structure. These functions are from the libraries Pandas, Numpy, and NetworkX.


# What tools are being used to run Graph Quest:
Graph Quest's base language is Python. We also implemented Pandas, Numpy, and NetworkX in the project so you can also use functions from those libraries as well. Graph quest's repo is also running a Travis ci build test program to check that the current build is working. The individual classes also have their own unit testing files to check for class correctness. 

# How do I use Graph Quest:
Right now graph quest can be included in your code after you download the main files and put them in your project directory. After that you can start working with the library by reading in a csv file, creating a graph object, or taking an already made adjacency matrix and performing algorithms on it. At the end of the process you can save your matrix to a csv file or create a visualization of the graph using the NetworkX aspect of the library. Keep in mind that during this process you also have access to Pandas and Numpy libraries and are welcome to use those functions as well.

# How do I get started?:
In the Graph Quest github page there is a main.py python file. This file acts as an example file for you to look at run to get a feel for how the library works. You can also look over the comments in the classes and see which functions do what.

# What if I have questions or need support?:
If you have questions about the project you can contact the developers here by creating a ticket with the library. You can also directly contact the contributers using the email listed with their account (if there is one listed).
